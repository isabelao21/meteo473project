### Explanation:
- **Headers**: Use `#` for the main title, `##` for subheaders, and `###` for sub-subheaders.
- **Bullet Points**: Use `-` or `*` for creating bullet points.
- **Code Blocks**: Wrap inline code with single backticks (`) and multi-line code blocks with triple backticks (```).
- **Table of Contents**: The `Table of Contents` section is optional but helps navigate long README files.
- **Bold and Italic**: You can use `**text**` for bold and `*text*` for italics.

This format is clean, readable, and easy to follow, making it suitable for Python-based projects or any other type.
